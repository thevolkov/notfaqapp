    question: 'What the heck is Notcoin?',
    answer: 'It‚Äôs like a crypto Tamagotchi inside Telegram ‚Äî you tap a coin, your brain releases dopamine, and one day you might become a millionaire. Maybe. Probably not. But maybe.'
  },
  {
    id: '2',
    question: 'So I just‚Ä¶ tap the screen?',
    answer: 'Yes. That‚Äôs the game. Just tap. Like your rent depends on it. Like your ex is watching. Like you‚Äôre mining Bitcoin manually.'
  },
  {
    id: '3',
    question: 'Is this even real crypto?',
    answer: 'Notcoin started as a meme. Then it became a movement. Then a token. Now it‚Äôs on the blockchain. So yes. It‚Äôs real. As real as your dreams.'
  },
  {
    id: '4',
    question: 'How do I get more Notcoin?',
    answer: 'Tap harder. Invite your grandma. Join a squad. Complete quests. Sell your soul (just kidding‚Ä¶ unless?).'
  },
  {
    id: '5',
    question: 'What‚Äôs a squad? Do I need one?',
    answer: 'Yes. Squads are like cults, but with more clicking. You join one, tap with them, and rise together. Or fall. Either way, it‚Äôs chaos and fun.'
  },
  {
    id: '6',
    question: 'Why does my energy run out like my motivation on Mondays?',
    answer: 'Because life isn‚Äôt fair. But you can recharge it. Just like your phone. Or your will to live after Monday meetings.'
  },
  {
    id: '7',
    question: 'Can I cash out my Notcoin and buy a Lambo?',
    answer: 'Eventually. When $NOT drops and it moons. Or maybe you‚Äôll afford a sandwich. Either way, that‚Äôs crypto, baby.'
  },
  {
    id: '8',
    question: 'Is this safe or will I end up hacked like my Roblox account in 2012?',
    answer: 'Totally safe. Runs inside Telegram. No shady apps. Just don‚Äôt click links that promise "10,000 FREE NOTCOIN ü§ë".'
  },
  {
    id: '9',
    question: 'What happens after the tapping ends?',
    answer: 'The prophecy says: token launch, airdrops, maybe staking, maybe world domination. We wait. And we tap.'
  },
  {
    id: '10',
    question: 'Can I make my own Notcoin?',
    answer: 'Technically yes. Telegram lets you build Mini Apps. Just bring code, caffeine, and questionable life choices.'
  },
  {
    id: '666',
    question: '‚õîÔ∏è Don\'t open this tab. Ok? OK?????',
    answer: ''
