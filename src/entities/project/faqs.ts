    question: 'What the heck is Notcoin?',
    answer: 'It’s like a crypto Tamagotchi inside Telegram — you tap a coin, your brain releases dopamine, and one day you might become a millionaire. Maybe. Probably not. But maybe.'
  },
  {
    id: '2',
    question: 'So I just… tap the screen?',
    answer: 'Yes. That’s the game. Just tap. Like your rent depends on it. Like your ex is watching. Like you’re mining Bitcoin manually.'
  },
  {
    id: '3',
    question: 'Is this even real crypto?',
    answer: 'Notcoin started as a meme. Then it became a movement. Then a token. Now it’s on the blockchain. So yes. It’s real. As real as your dreams.'
  },
  {
    id: '4',
    question: 'How do I get more Notcoin?',
    answer: 'Tap harder. Invite your grandma. Join a squad. Complete quests. Sell your soul (just kidding… unless?).'
  },
  {
    id: '5',
    question: 'What’s a squad? Do I need one?',
    answer: 'Yes. Squads are like cults, but with more clicking. You join one, tap with them, and rise together. Or fall. Either way, it’s chaos and fun.'
  },
  {
    id: '6',
    question: 'Why does my energy run out like my motivation on Mondays?',
    answer: 'Because life isn’t fair. But you can recharge it. Just like your phone. Or your will to live after Monday meetings.'
  },
  {
    id: '7',
    question: 'Can I cash out my Notcoin and buy a Lambo?',
    answer: 'Eventually. When $NOT drops and it moons. Or maybe you’ll afford a sandwich. Either way, that’s crypto, baby.'
  },
  {
    id: '8',
    question: 'Is this safe or will I end up hacked like my Roblox account in 2012?',
    answer: 'Totally safe. Runs inside Telegram. No shady apps. Just don’t click links that promise "10,000 FREE NOTCOIN 🤑".'
  },
  {
    id: '9',
    question: 'What happens after the tapping ends?',
    answer: 'The prophecy says: token launch, airdrops, maybe staking, maybe world domination. We wait. And we tap.'
  },
  {
    id: '10',
    question: 'Can I make my own Notcoin?',
    answer: 'Technically yes. Telegram lets you build Mini Apps. Just bring code, caffeine, and questionable life choices.'
  }
